# Product Context

## Why this project exists:
This project aims to create a data collection form for accountants to gather necessary information from their clients.

## What problems it solves:
It solves the problem of inefficient data collection and management that accountants face every financial year. The form will streamline the process of requesting and receiving client information, making it easier to organize and analyze.

## How it should work:
The form should present a clear and structured way for clients to provide the required data. It should be a single-page form with a progress indicator. The form should include fields for various categories of financial information, as outlined in the existing form details.
