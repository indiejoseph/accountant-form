# Active Context

## What I'm working on now:
I am currently creating the initial prototype for the accountant data collection form. This involves setting up the project, creating the Memory Bank files, and scaffolding the basic form structure.

## Recent changes:
* Gathered requirements and details about the existing form.
* Decided on the technology stack: Tailwind CSS, React, Biome, Bun, Next.js (app route), and Mantine UI component library.
* Determined that the form will be a single page with a progress indicator.
* The deployment will likely be a Docker container.

## Next steps:
1. Install Mantine, Biome and other necessary dependencies.
2. Create the main form component with the necessary fields based on the existing form details.
3. Implement the progress indicator.
4. Style the form using Tailwind CSS and Mantine components.
5. Set up basic form validation.
6. Prepare a basic Dockerfile for potential deployment.
