# System Patterns

## How the system is built:
The system will be built as a Next.js application with a React frontend. Mantine will be used as the UI component library, and Tailwind CSS will be used for styling.

## Key technical decisions:
* Using Next.js for its routing capabilities and server-side rendering features.
* Using Mantine for its pre-built components and ease of use.
* Using Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach to styling.
* Using Bun as the package manager and runtime environment.

## Architecture patterns:
The application will follow a component-based architecture, with reusable components for form fields, sections, and the progress indicator.
